# gnome-shell-extensions-mediaplayer

gnome-shell-extensions-mediaplayer is a simple extension for controlling any 
MPRIS v2.1 capable Mediaplayer.

This extension will monitor DBus to look for active players automatically 
(player names are referenced in the metadata.json file). All active players 
are shown in the gnome-shell volume menu by default.

# Screenshots

By default, media players shows up in the volume menu:

But you can have the media players in a separate menu (see settings):

Notice the support of playlists in Banshee (MPRIS 2.1 player interface).
